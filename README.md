WP diaspora postwidget (Work in Progress!)
======================

This plugin allows you to write new posts to Diaspora. You can configure a diaspora-account in an options-page and have a new dashbaord-widget that allows you to write posts.

Features:

* Use a Diaspora account with multiple users without them knowing the account-credentials.
* Integrated preview before posting.


This will later be expanded to provide other features. Watch the issues section for details. :)
